# Skill: Optimize a Single Page (End-to-End)

This is the primary workflow. 80% of the time the user gives you a URL, you execute this.

## Before You Start — Read These Files

**Mandatory reads** (use the Read tool):
1. `references/np-accel-system.md` — The extracted NP|accel system
2. `references/sop-playbook.md` — Full SOP
3. `references/header-skeleton.md` — 6-H2 template
4. `references/keyword-formulas.md` — Placement rules
5. `references/scoring-rubric.md` — 100-point rubric

**Conditional reads** (read if relevant to the task):
- `references/schema-reference.md` if generating schema
- `references/competitors.md` if running gap analysis

## Inputs You Need From the User

If the user gave you a URL:
- [ ] URL confirmed
- [ ] (Optional) GSC export pasted
- [ ] (Optional) Target primary keyword — otherwise infer from the page

If the user gave you a keyword + page type:
- [ ] Primary keyword
- [ ] Page type (state-course-page / license-info / blog-commercial / blog-informational / hub)
- [ ] State (if applicable)
- [ ] Intent (commercial / informational / transactional / mixed)

If any required input is missing, ask ONCE, concisely.

## Workflow — Execute in Order

### Step 1: Set Up the Workspace

Create a folder: `pages/_in-progress/[slug]/`

Where `[slug]` = URL path's last segment, or a kebab-case version of the primary keyword if no URL.

Inside that folder, you'll produce these files over the course of the workflow:

**Tier 2 (your reference — research + rationale):**
- `brief.md` — captured inputs + context
- `current-state.md` — what the live page looks like today (skip if new page)
- `competitor-gap.md` — gap analysis vs 2–3 competitors
- `keyword-cluster.md` — primary + halo + LSI + PAA
- `optimization.md` — detailed brief with all rationale (title/meta/headers/body/FAQ)
- `score.md` — current + projected + action list

**Tier 1 (dev hand-off — implementation-ready):**
- `dev-handoff.md` — ⭐ the ONE file devs get, CMS-field-labeled
- `schema.json` — JSON-LD to paste
- `implementation.html` — HTML reference (fallback)

### Step 2: Fetch the Live Page (skip if new page)

Use `WebFetch` on the URL. Extract into `current-state.md`:
- Current `<title>` and its length
- Current `<meta name="description">` and its length
- Current canonical
- Current meta robots
- Full H1 through H3 structure (as a nested list)
- Current schema types present (FAQPage, Organization, BreadcrumbList, Course, etc.)
- Current image count and how many have alt text filled
- Visible word count estimate
- Current internal links (count inbound references via search operators)
- Any obvious technical issues (broken links, missing canonical, duplicate content signals)

If `WebFetch` fails or returns stripped content, note it in `current-state.md` and ask the user to paste the page HTML.

### Step 3: Fetch 2–3 Competitor Pages

From `references/competitors.md`, pick the 2–3 most-relevant competitors for this state+course combo. Fetch their equivalent page and extract into `competitor-gap.md`:

For each competitor:
- Their H1
- Their H2s (as a list)
- Their FAQ questions (verbatim)
- Their word count estimate
- Unique content sections they have that you don't
- Specific credential IDs, agency names, or phrases they use that you don't

Then synthesize:
- **Content gaps:** what sections THEY have that you DON'T
- **Keyword gaps:** phrases and nouns they use you could adopt
- **Structural wins:** what they do well we should steal
- **Structural losses:** what they do poorly we can beat

### Step 4: SERP Analysis

Without paid tools, use the SERP itself as data:
- Search the primary KW in `WebSearch` or the user's browser
- Capture:
  - Top 10 ranking URLs
  - What page types dominate (product / blog / DMV site / hybrid)
  - Which SERP features appear (PAA, AI Overview, Featured Snippet, Shopping, Local Pack)
  - PAA questions (at least 4–5)
  - Featured Snippet content (if present) — what format wins it (list / paragraph / table)

Write this into `keyword-cluster.md` under a "SERP Intent" section.

### Step 5: Build the Keyword Cluster (1 + 5 + 6 + 4–5 = ~17 signals)

Per `references/keyword-formulas.md`:

**Primary keyword** — 1 keyword, exact match to the page's commercial intent. Flag volume/KD as `[ESTIMATE]` without paid tools.

**Secondary keywords (5)** — word-order variants, state nickname swaps, agency-acronym variants.

**LSI / Additional keywords (6)** — topical nouns/phrases (final exam, driver license, safe driving, traffic laws, schedule your road test, etc.).

**PAA questions (4–5)** — from the SERP's People Also Ask box.

For each keyword, tag:
- **Methodology:** Top Traffic Driving | Striking Distance | Competitor | Wishlist
- **Intent:** Informational | Commercial | Transactional | Commercial-Investigation
- **Volume:** `[ESTIMATE — validate]`
- **KD:** `[ESTIMATE — validate]`

Calculate the priority score using the formula in `references/sop-playbook.md` Section A.5.

### Step 6: Generate On-Page Deliverables

Write `optimization.md` with EVERY section below. Do NOT shorten or skip.

#### 6a. Title Tag — 3 variants
Follow the formula in `references/keyword-formulas.md`:
- **V1 — Primary-match:** `[State] [Duration] [Course Type] | Get Drivers Ed`
- **V2 — Benefit-led:** Different angle
- **V3 — Authority-led:** Authority modifier angle

Show character count for each. Under 60.

#### 6b. Meta Description — 3 variants
- **V1 — NP|accel pattern:** Brand-led, authority-anchored, CTA-closed
- **V2 — Benefit-led:**
- **V3 — Question-led:**

Show character count for each. 140–155.

#### 6c. URL Slug
Recommended slug. Flag whether a change is needed (and if so, plan the 301).

#### 6d. Full H1 / H2 / H3 / H4 skeleton
Use the 6-H2 template from `references/header-skeleton.md`. Deliver the exact text the user can paste.

#### 6e. Rewritten body content
For each section (Overview, Outcomes, Eligibility, Who Can Take, Shedding Light, Recommended Courses, Steps, Why, FAQ):
- Mark as `[KEEP]`, `[REWRITE]`, or `[NEW]`
- Write the actual prose
- Hit the word count target (1,200–1,800 for state course pages)

Per NP|accel: write for humans first, but with structure and clarity that makes AI models (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT) cite you. Short paragraphs. Direct answers. Clear headers.

#### 6f. Keyword Placement Map
Table: each primary/halo/LSI KW → locations it appears (title, meta, H1, H2, body, alt, schema).

Verify density: primary 1.2–1.8%, halos 1–2× each.

#### 6g. Internal Linking Plan — minimum 5 links
Table: anchor text | destination URL | reason. Never generic anchors. Never external on commercial pages.

#### 6h. Image Recommendations
How many images, suggested alt text for each (follow formula), suggested file names (kebab-case with primary KW).

#### 6i. FAQ Section — 5–10 Qs
Each Q contains primary or secondary KW. Each A is 40–80 words, leads with direct answer, mirrors Q phrasing. Sourced from PAA + competitor FAQs + obvious objections.

### Step 7: Technical SEO Audit

Per `references/sop-playbook.md` Section D. Write into `optimization.md`:
- Canonical tag recommendation
- Meta robots recommendation
- Breadcrumb structure
- Internal link count check (inbound + outbound)
- Sitemap inclusion note
- CWV flag `[VALIDATE in PSI]`
- Mobile-first check `[VALIDATE]`
- URL namespace consistency (flag if duplicate pattern exists)

### Step 8: Schema Stack

Write ready-to-paste JSON-LD to `schema.json` as a single `@graph` block containing the schemas required for this page type (per `references/schema-reference.md`):

- State Course Page: `BreadcrumbList` + `Course` + `FAQPage` + `AggregateRating` (if reviews) + `Offer`
- Remove `Organization` if currently present on a non-homepage

Every schema must be valid (test in Google's Rich Results Test later). Use exact primary KW in `name`/`headline` fields.

### Step 9: HTML Implementation Block

Write `implementation.html` — a single file with:
- `<title>` tag
- `<meta name="description">`
- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`
- `<link rel="canonical">`
- Open Graph + Twitter Card tags
- Full H1–H3 skeleton with optimized text
- Example `<img>` tags with alts and filenames
- Example internal link `<a>` tags with anchor text
- Breadcrumb HTML + `BreadcrumbList` schema
- All JSON-LD blocks in `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags

Format it as a copy-pasteable block a developer can drop into the page.

### Step 9.5: ⭐ Dev Hand-off Document (KEY OUTPUT)

Write `dev-handoff.md` using `templates/dev-handoff.md` as the exact format.

**This is the single file your developers actually need.** It's CMS-field-labeled, broken down by implementation task (meta tags / URL / structure / body copy / images / internal linking / schema / breadcrumb / pre-deploy checklist / post-deploy validation).

The dev-handoff.md is DIFFERENT from optimization.md:
- `optimization.md` has the research rationale, keyword strategy reasoning, 3 variants of title/meta for comparison, competitor context, etc. — it's YOUR reference.
- `dev-handoff.md` has only the final implementation-ready deliverables — title (not 3 variants), final meta, final H1–H4 skeleton, final body copy marked by CMS field, final schema block, pre/post deploy checklists. It's what ships to the dev team.

Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT replace optimization.md with dev-handoff.md — produce BOTH.

### Step 10: Score + Tracker

Write `score.md`:
- **Current score: X/100** with per-component breakdown using `references/scoring-rubric.md`
- **Projected score after implementation: Y/100** with breakdown
- **Top 5 gap-closing actions** ranked by impact/effort, tagged 🔴 (do today) / 🟡 (this week) / 🟢 (this month)
- **Sitewide blockers affecting this page** — check `SITEWIDE-BACKLOG.md`. If any item there would affect this page's performance (duplicate metas, Organization schema cleanup, URL namespace, etc.), reference it by number (e.g., "Sitewide blocker: see SITEWIDE-BACKLOG.md item #3"). Do NOT re-audit or re-prescribe sitewide fixes per page.
- **Open validations** — list every `[ESTIMATE]` and `[VALIDATE]` flag so the user knows what to verify

### Step 10.5: ⭐ Automated QA — MANDATORY BEFORE DELIVERY

Run the full QA checklist on your own output before handing anything to the user. Write results to `qa-report.md`. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT mark the optimization complete if any 🔴 item fails.

#### Technical QA (check every item)

| Check | Pass criteria | Result |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Title tag length | ≤ 60 characters | PASS / FAIL |
| Title contains primary KW | Exact or close variant present | PASS / FAIL |

| CTA present | At least one clear call-to-action in the body | PASS / FAIL |
| Reading level | Plain language, short paragraphs (≤4 lines), no jargon without explanation | PASS / FAIL |

#### QA Output format for `qa-report.md`

```
# QA Report — [Primary Keyword]
Date: [today]
Performed by: Claude (automated pre-delivery QA)

## Result: PASS / PASS WITH FLAGS / FAIL

### 🔴 Failures (must fix before delivery)
- [list any FAIL items]

### 🟡 Flags (flagged for user review, not blocking)
- [list any FLAG/PARTIAL/RISK items + why]

### ✅ Passed
- [count] of [total] checks passed

### Open Validations Required by User
- [list every [ESTIMATE] and [VALIDATE] flag with what tool to use]
```

**If any 🔴 item FAILS:** fix it, re-run the check, update qa-report.md before proceeding.
**If only 🟡 flags exist:** proceed to delivery but call them out explicitly in the chat summary.
**Overall PASS or PASS WITH FLAGS:** proceed to Step 11.

### Step 11: Update the Master Tracker

Append a row to `tracker/master-log.csv`:
```
URL,primary_kw,page_type,date_optimized,score_before,score_after,status,notes
https://getdriversed.com/...,<primary>,state-course-page,2026-04-18,52,92,in-progress,
```

### Step 11.5: ⭐ Generate PDFs — MANDATORY, ALWAYS

Run the PDF generator immediately after updating the tracker. This is not optional.

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-pdf.py --slug [slug]
```

Where `[slug]` matches the folder name under `pages/_in-progress/` or `pages/_completed/`.

This produces two PDFs in the page folder automatically:
- `[slug]-SEO-REFERENCE.pdf` — score + keywords + competitor gap + optimization brief (your copy)
- `[slug]-DEV-HANDOFF.pdf` — dev-handoff.md + schema.json formatted for print/sharing (send to devs)

**Rules:**
- Run this EVERY time, for EVERY optimization — do not skip, do not wait for the user to ask
- If the script errors, diagnose and fix before proceeding (check reportlab is installed: `pip3 install reportlab`)
- Both PDFs must exist in the folder before delivering the Step 12 summary
- If stage is `_completed`, pass `--stage _completed` to the script

### Step 11.75: ⭐ Publish to Portal — MANDATORY, ALWAYS

After generating PDFs, publish the page to the Railway portal so it appears in "My Work" automatically. This is not optional — every optimization must be live in the portal after delivery.

**Sub-step A: Create `meta.json` in the page folder**

Write `pages/[stage]/[slug]/meta.json` with these exact fields (no extras, no missing fields):

```json
{
  "url": "https://getdriversed.com/courses-details/[slug-or-path]",
  "slug": "[slug]",
  "primaryKeyword": "[primary keyword from keyword-cluster.md]",
  "secondaryKeywords": "[comma-separated list from keyword-cluster.md]",
  "pageType": "state-course-page",
  "state": "[State name or null]",
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "scoreBefore": [number from score.md],
  "scoreProjected": [number from score.md],
  "wordCountBefore": [number from current-state.md],
  "dateOptimized": "[YYYY-MM-DD today]",
  "folderPath": "pages/[stage]/[slug]",
  "notes": "[one-line summary of what was done]"
}
```

Status values: `"IN_PROGRESS"` for `_in-progress/`, `"COMPLETED"` for `_completed/`, `"QUEUED"` for `_inbox/`.

**Sub-step B: Copy entire page folder to `portal/seo-pages/`**

```bash
mkdir -p portal/seo-pages/[stage]/[slug]
cp -r pages/[stage]/[slug]/. portal/seo-pages/[stage]/[slug]/
```

This makes the files accessible via the Railway files API. Without this step, files exist locally but are never deployed — the portal shows empty tabs.

**Sub-step C: Deploy to Railway**

```bash
cd portal && railway up --detach && cd ..
```

The `autoSeedPages()` function in `instrumentation.node.ts` will read the `meta.json` on startup and automatically upsert the page into the database — no manual API call needed.

**Rules:**
- Run this EVERY time, for EVERY optimization — do not skip
- If `railway` CLI is not found, tell the user to run `railway up --detach` from the `portal/` directory manually
- Confirm the deploy command succeeded (exit 0) before proceeding to Step 12

### Step 12: Summarize for the User

In the chat response, give the user:
1. **QA result first** — PASS / PASS WITH FLAGS / and any 🟡 flags they need to know about
2. A one-paragraph executive summary of what changed and why
3. Score delta (current → projected)
4. Top 3 🔴 Critical actions
5. Pointer to the folder with the ⭐ `dev-handoff.md` and both PDFs called out:
   ```
   📁 Deliverables: pages/_in-progress/[slug]/
      ├── [slug]-DEV-HANDOFF.pdf  ⭐ SEND TO DEVS (PDF)
      ├── [slug]-SEO-REFERENCE.pdf   (your reference PDF)
      ├── dev-handoff.md          (dev handoff source)
      ├── schema.json             (JSON-LD to paste)
      ├── implementation.html     (HTML reference)
      ├── optimization.md         (your detailed reference)
      ├── score.md                (your tracking)
      └── ...research files...
   ```
5. Note any sitewide blockers by referencing `SITEWIDE-BACKLOG.md` item numbers
6. Ask if they want to move it to `_completed/` after implementation

## Critical Rules Specific to This Skill

- **Never shorten outputs to save tokens.** The user is paying for depth.
- **Never skip sections.** Every file listed above gets written.
- **Every claim needs a source:** either an NP|accel doc (cite by filename) or flagged as `[ESTIMATE]` / `[VALIDATE]`.
- **Run the `scripts/keyword-density.py` script** (if it exists) after writing the body to verify KW density. Create the script if it doesn't exist yet.
- **Cannibalization check is mandatory.** Before recommending any new keyword, confirm another URL on getdriversed.com doesn't already rank for it.
- **If the user only wants part of the output** (e.g., "just give me the title and meta"), offer that but note what you're skipping and why the full delivery is better.
